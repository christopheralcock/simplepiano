Repo for my functioning web audio api instruments found here:

http://variousmusicappsofchris.herokuapp.com/

Everything works using just the HTML5 web audio api thus far, keeping everything light weight.  All developed to work on Chrome, with limited success so far on other browsers.




javascript key events simultaneously work with audiocontext synthesis and send back to an array on the sinatra server
when the array is equal to the preset array, the sinatra server sends the unlock signal over the api
